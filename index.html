			<h1>____What is Lorem Ipsum?____</h1>
		<p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

		<p><h3>Explanation of floating in water</h3>
		The force felt by an object immersed in a liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid removed by the object. So a ship of two thousand tons will continue to sink until it removes two thousand tons of water. If the ship removes two thousand tons of water before it sinks, then the ship will float and not sink. This will be possible if the density of the vessel is less than the density of water removed by the vessel. This is done by leaving space inside the ship. As a result, the ship floats after removing the water of equal weight.

		<h3>History</h3>
		The first watercraft is said to have been around 10,000 years ago.

		<h3>Duration</h3>
		The average lifespan of cargo ships suitable for most seafarers is 20 to 30 years. If a ship is made of a pair of wood (plywood) or fiberglass, it is suitable for sailing for thirty to forty years. Ships made of hard wood are used more often; However, it requires regular maintenance. With careful maintenance, steel deck ships have been in operation for hundreds of years. The wreck is sent to the shipbreaker for scraping. It is also reused in museums or for artificial display.

		Many ships are not built on land. Its life is ended by fire, collision, drowning. According to the United Nations, there are more than three million shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
